# Scientific Python Course Projects

This repository hosts information for the students enrolled into Scientific Programming with Python course that is read at Constructor University Bremen in fall 2024. 

The lab component of the course includes weekly assignments, targeted at the students who are new to Python. However, those who already have some experience with Python may find the weekly assignments 
not challenging enough. If this case there is an option of working on bigger course projects instead of the weekly assignments. 

## Brief Outline

The goal of the course project is to build a relatively complex application, working together with fellow students and using common software development practices, such as code reviews, unit tests, etc. 
We have prepared a few application ideas, however, you are free to suggest your own one.

Your work on a course project will be split into three phases with different kinds of tasks and teamwork. See the details on the project phases below.

A course project has the same weight in the final score as weekly assignments (33%). Completion of every task in the scope of a project will provide some "credits", and the more credits you gain, the better. See the details on the grading below.

## Labs Coordinator

The work on the course projects is coordinated by Dmitry Barashev.
